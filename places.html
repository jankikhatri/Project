        <h3>Lambert Castle</h3>
        <p>“The Castle,” a well-known landmark in Northern New Jersey, is located on Garret Mountain overlooking the City of Paterson.
            Once a private residence, the building is fashioned after an English castle.
            Catholina Lambert, an English immigrant who made his fortune in the silk industry, built the Castle in 1892-93.
            He named it “Belle Vista.”
            Many prominent individuals of that era, including President McKinley, visited the Lambert family in their luxurious residence.</p>

        <h3>Ringwood Manor</h3>
        <p>Ringwood Manor is a National Historic Landmark District, having historical importance spanning from Native American occupation through the early 20th century.
            The surrounding Ramapo Mountains' rich magnetite iron deposits made the area a major iron supplier and became the home to a succession of ironmasters for over two hundred years.
            During the Gilded Age, Ringwood Manor became a large summer estate for partners Peter Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt and their families.
            In 1938, the house, its contents, and the surrounding property were donated by the family to the State of New Jersey as a museum and a state park.
            With original historical structures, gardens, and landscapes on 582 acres and extensive historical collections illustrative of family life, community, industry and culture, Ringwood Manor is a unique repository of American history. </p>

        <img src="images/image19.jpg" alt="Twin Lights" style="width: 38%; height: 15%">
        <h3>Twin Lights</h3>
        <p>A lighthouse on Sandy Hook Lighthouse, just four miles north of the Highlands, was established in 1764 to mark the entrance to New York Harbor.
            While there are some clues that a lighthouse was established at Navesink around this same time, the evidence is inconclusive, and a pair of beacons built on the highlands in 1828 is considered the first Navesink Lighthouse.
            Congress appropriated funds for the lights on May 18, 1826, allowing 2 ¾ acres of land to be purchased from Nimrod Woodward for $600.
            Instead of a single tower, two octagonal ones, constructed of blue split stone and separated by 320 feet, were built on the summit.
            Charles Smith of Stonington, Connecticut erected the towers and a dwelling, located midway between them, for the cost of $8,440, while David Melville of Newport, Rhode Island supplied the necessary lamps and reflectors for $1,850.
            When Keeper Joseph Doty first lit the Twin Lights of Navesink, the north tower exhibited a fixed, white light and the south tower a flashing, white light. The twin lights were one of seven stations in the United States to feature two towers.</p>
